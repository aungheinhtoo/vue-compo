## Components in Tailwind+Vue

### Assumptions

1. Parent component handles the delete logic for alerts.
2. Color for warning alert is the same as Secondary Button.
3. Hover and click effects for buttons are handled in the buttom component. Parent controls disabled/enabled.

### TODOs

1. Consider and research better format for props.
2. Incorporate tests for each component using `@testing-library/vue` and overall with `storybook`.
3. Build and test with another project.
